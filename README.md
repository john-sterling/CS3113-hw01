CS3113-hw01
===========
Assignment was to display at least three shapes, two of them must be textured and one must use vertex colors.  In addition there must be some animation.

Interesting thing when attempting this exercise was that some of my image files do not display properly.  For example, none of the photo files show "normally", neither do the space invader files and the black&white photo of Carmack actually crashes the program at the call to glTexImage2D in my LoadTexture function.  But my smiley face worked fine as did the "spaceship" from the archives provided by the instructor.
